# Final Model

In this section, I used transfer learning to train EfficientNetB2 (pre-trained on ImageNet) on the full Food-101 dataset with 101,000 
images and 101 classes. I was able to achieve a top-1 accuracy of 73.2% and a top-5 accuracy of 91.2%. The model weights are given
in the file "effnetb2_model_5_results.zip".
