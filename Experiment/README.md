# Experiment
This is the experimental portion of the repository. Here, I used only 3 classes rather than the full 101 classes. With 3 
classes, that gives 3000 images total, with 2250 train images and 750 test images.

This section is made up of two subsections â€” Experiment 1 and Experiment 2.

## Experiment 1
In this section, I created a small CNN model from scratch and trained it. I was able to achieve a test accuaracy of 81.2%
right off the bat, but I wanted to improve my results further, so I experimented with different hyperparameter values. I was able
to gain a small improvement and brought up the test accuracy to 85.5%.

## Experiment 2
In this section, I experimented with 4 different model architectures. Strangely, the model architecture from experiment 1 was somehow
performing worse during this experiment (may have been due to an error on my part, but it's still a mystery at the moment). The other
model architectures also did not perform as well as the model from experiment 1, but I did find a best-performing model architecture
with a test accuracy of 76.2%.
